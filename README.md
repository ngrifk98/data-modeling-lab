# data-modeling-lab: Recipe and Grocery List App

This repository contains the data model, SQL statements, and documentation for the Recipe and Grocery List App. The app allows users to create, share, and manage recipes and grocery lists. Additionally, users can view other people's recipes, add recipe ingredients to their grocery lists, and create custom occasions for their recipes.

## Schema Diagram

The schema diagram represents the data model for the Recipe and Grocery List App. It visualizes the relationships between different tables and their attributes.

## Table Planning

In the "Table Planning" section, you will find a breakdown of each table required for the app. For each table, we have listed its respective columns along with a brief explanation of the data to be stored in those columns and the chosen data types.

## SQL Statements

The "SQL Statements" section includes the CREATE TABLE statements for all the tables in the app's database. These statements define the structure of each table and the relationships between them.

## Inserting Data

The "Inserting Data" section (optional) demonstrates how to insert sample data into the tables. It provides INSERT statements that can be executed in a PostgreSQL environment to populate the database with initial data.

## Getting Started

To use the data model and SQL statements for the Recipe and Grocery List App, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a PostgreSQL environment to run the SQL statements.
3. Execute the CREATE TABLE statements to create the database tables.
4. (Optional) Use the INSERT statements to insert sample data into the tables.
5. Start building your Recipe and Grocery List App!
